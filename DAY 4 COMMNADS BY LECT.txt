------------------------------
what is user:- a user account is used to provide security bounderies between different people and programmes
that run commands.

/etc/passwd      :-      store user info
/etc/shadow      :-      store user credentials
/etc/group       :-      stored groups info
/etc/gshadow     :-      stored groups credentials

check user exists or not:- id user_name

how to find out top 10 lines from /etc/passwd :- head /etc/passwd
    to find top 3 lines from /etc/passwd:- head -3 /etc/passwd

how to find out bottom 3 lines from /etc/passwd:-   tail -3 /etc/passwd

filter patterns inside text file:-
--------------------------------
# grep "root" /etc/passwd
# grep ^"root" /etc/passwd ( will search only line starts with root)
# grep "bash"$ /etc/passwd ( will search only line ends with bash)

wc command is used for count words,lines and character/bytes ; wc /etc/passwd

pipe ( | ) :- output of 1st command would be the input of second command

# cat /etc/passwd | grep "devops"

how linux identify about default shells and default user policy:-
